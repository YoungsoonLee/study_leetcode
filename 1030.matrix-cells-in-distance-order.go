 * Testcase Example:  '1\n2\n0\n0'
 *
 * We are given a matrix with R rows and C columns has cells with integer
 * coordinates (r, c), where 0 <= r < R and 0 <= c < C.
 * 
 * Additionally, we are given a cell in that matrix with coordinates (r0, c0).
 * 
 * Return the coordinates of all cells in the matrix, sorted by their distance
 * from (r0, c0) from smallest distance to largest distance.  Here, the
 * distance between two cells (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) is the Manhattan distance,
 * |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|.  (You may return the answer in any order that
 * satisfies this condition.)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: R = 1, C = 2, r0 = 0, c0 = 0
 * Output: [[0,0],[0,1]]
 * Explanation: The distances from (r0, c0) to other cells are: [0,1]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: R = 2, C = 2, r0 = 0, c0 = 1
 * Output: [[0,1],[0,0],[1,1],[1,0]]
 * Explanation: The distances from (r0, c0) to other cells are: [0,1,1,2]
 * The answer [[0,1],[1,1],[0,0],[1,0]] would also be accepted as correct.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: R = 2, C = 3, r0 = 1, c0 = 2
 * Output: [[1,2],[0,2],[1,1],[0,1],[1,0],[0,0]]
 * Explanation: The distances from (r0, c0) to other cells are: [0,1,1,2,2,3]
 * There are other answers that would also be accepted as correct, such as
 * [[1,2],[1,1],[0,2],[1,0],[0,1],[0,0]].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= R <= 100
 * 1 <= C <= 100
 * 0 <= r0 < R
 * 0 <= c0 < C
 * 
 *
