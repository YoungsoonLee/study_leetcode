 *
 * On a staircase, the i-th step has some non-negative cost cost[i] assigned (0
 * indexed).
 *
 * Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. You need to
 * find minimum cost to reach the top of the floor, and you can either start
 * from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: cost = [10, 15, 20]
 * Output: 15
 * Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[1], pay that cost and go to the
 * top.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: cost = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[0], and only step on 1s, skipping
 * cost[3].
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * cost will have a length in the range [2, 1000].
 * Every cost[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 999].
